# Project Overview

This is a personal blog created by GeonDev, a backend programmer. The blog is built using Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages. It contains articles on various technical topics, including algorithms, databases, IT, Linux, projects, Spring, and Vue. The articles are written in Korean and often include code snippets and images.

## Building and Running

This is a Jekyll-based website. To run it locally, you need to have Ruby and Jekyll installed.

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

2.  **Run the Jekyll server:**

    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

    The site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Development Conventions

The blog posts are written in Markdown and are located in the `_posts` directory. The posts are organized into subdirectories based on their category. Each post has a header with metadata like the layout, title, date, author, categories, and tags.

Images are stored in the `images` directory, with subdirectories for each category.
